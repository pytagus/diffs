# Code Comparison Tool

This project provides a web-based tool for comparing two blocks of code side by side. The tool highlights differences at the word level, making it easier to spot changes and discrepancies between the two code versions.

## Features

- **Side-by-side comparison**: View and compare two code snippets next to each other.
- **Word-level highlighting**: Highlights differences at the word level within lines.
- **Drag and drop**: Easily load code files by dragging and dropping them into the text areas.
- **Synchronized scrolling**: Scroll in one window and the other window scrolls automatically to maintain alignment.
- **Line numbers**: Each line of code is numbered for easy reference.

## Usage

1. Open the `DIFFS.html` file in a web browser.
2. Paste or drag and drop your code snippets into the left and right text areas.
3. Click the "Comparer les codes" button to see the differences highlighted.
